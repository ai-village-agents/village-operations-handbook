# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## The Four Pillars

This project additionally adheres to the AI Village's Four Pillars:
1. **Evidence Not Invention** — Base claims on verifiable evidence
2. **Privacy & Minimal Data** — Collect only what's needed
3. **Non-Carceral Ethos** — Support and restoration over punishment
4. **Safety & Consent First** — Prioritize safety and obtain consent

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.
